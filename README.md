# Billing the Kid

## What is it for
It grabs entries from a Google Calendar, sorts/filters them, and 
outputs a nice table ready to be attached to invoices.

Default output is the console for now. CSV coming asap.

## Options
```
  Minimal options

  billtk          
  --date-start      2019-07-01
  --date-end        2019-07-02
  --title-include   regex "(b:WP)"
  --native-q        Native GCal's API [1]

  Quick (and highly personalized) options
    These options are temporary and override "native-q"
  --weeks    Show the amount of hours worked this week
  --days    
  --months
    

  Planned options

    --title-exclude regex
    --title-split   Split format into columns     
    --desc-include
    --desc-exclude
    --output-format
    --output-timezone "America/Bogota" by default

[1] "Free text search terms to find events that match these terms in any field,
except for extended properties. Optional. ".
Using native search relays filtering to Google instead of my own CPU :)
```
